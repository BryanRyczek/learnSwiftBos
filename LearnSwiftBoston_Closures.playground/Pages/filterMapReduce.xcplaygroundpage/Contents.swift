/* .filter, .map and .reduce are commonly used in Swift. They are really handy and used frequently so you'll probably want to master their use.
 
    .filter, .map and .reduce:
 
    1) operate on collection types like Arrays and Dictionaries (sets too!)
 
    2) are a substitute of for loops
 
    3) are part of the Swift Standard Library

// Challenge: take an array of [Int] and return array of even numbers

var filteredArray : [Int] = []

// FOR LOOP technique 

for number in array {
    if number % 2 == 0 {

// FILTER: .filter

// .filter signature

//func filter(_ isIncluded: (Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Element]

//things to note:

// .filter always returns an array!

// The isIncluded (Element) and [Element] are always of the same type, Swift is a strongly typed language!
// throws / rethrows: If you don't know error handling, you might be thrown off by seeing throws/rethrows. Don't worry, this shouldn't stop you from using .filter or any other closure that has throws/rethrows. All this does is equip the function to handle Errors, on an optional basis. If you are not handling errors in the closure, this notation is of no tangible concern.
// In a nutshell, what .filter does is iterate over a group of elements, and test that element against logic provided by you, the developer. A true result will include the Element in the returned [Element]; a false result will exclude it.


//filteredArray.filter(<#T##isIncluded: (Int) throws -> Bool##(Int) throws -> Bool#>)

/* MAP: .map loops/iterates over a collection and applies the same operation to each element in the collection.
 
 .map always returns an array! */

// func map<T>(_ transform: (Key, Value) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]

//things to note:

// .map does not have to return the same type as its input(s). It can return any type (inside an array of course!)


//Check out the difference in signature depending on if you are filtering a dictionary vs. an array!

// REDUCE:

// .reduce takes a group of elements and combines them into one Result

// to use .reduce, first start by deciding what type of result you desire. Then define an initial result of an identical type.

// .reduce signature

// func reduce<Result>(_ initialResult: Result, _ nextPartialResult: (Result, Element) throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result

//array.reduce(<#T##initialResult: τ_0_0##τ_0_0#>, <#T##nextPartialResult: (τ_0_0, Int) throws -> τ_0_0##(τ_0_0, Int) throws -> τ_0_0#>)

//traditional .reduce example

    $0 + $1
}

// as you may have noticed, nextPartialResult is a closure.

//1) The nextPartialResult closure is called with each iteration, each time with the unfinished result (running count) and the current Element from the sequence, returning the sum of the two.

// this is a tuple i've created to pass in as the initial value to the .reduce call
let resultType : (String, Int) = ("twenty", 20)
