//  Closures are, by default, @noescape in Swift 3. If you want your closure to be escaping, you must mark it with @escaping.

// What is an escaping closure?
// An escaping closure is a closure within a function that is able to outlive, or escape, the life/scope of the function.

//Why would I use an escaping closure?
// Many async tasks call a closure when the task returns. In many cases, the function containing the closure will finish before the closure is called, resulting in a crash.

//When should I use escaping vs. non-escaping? Why not always escaping just to be safe?
//1) This is a memory management question. A closure keeps a strong reference to every object the closure captures. This includes references to self. It's impossible to create a reference cycle with a @noescape closure, therefore you should use @noescape (default setting) whenever possible.

//since closures are first class citizens, they can be stored in arrays!
var completionHandlers: [() -> Void] = []

//Here we are attempting to store the completion handler in the array declared above. But we can't, unless the completion handler is defined as @escaping!
func someFunctionWithEscapingClosure(completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
    completionHandlers.append(completionHandler)

    /*if (download went well)
     */ completion(true) // return Data

//Here we have some boilerplate code for downloading a url in Swift 3. 

//Notice we take in: 1) a URL
//                   2) a completion closure that takes in (Data, Error) and returns -> Void.
